# Learning C

Just a little project which should help me with C language learning. 

It contains C language Samples, MinGW compiler installer, build script to build ALL the samples etc.

# To prepare build environment.
* Install .\Installers\mingw-get-setup.exe
* After installation the "MinGW Installation Manager" will appear
  * Install mingw32-base (for C language support)
  
# Build samples
Just run .\Build.ps1 script with powershell console but WORKING DIRECROTY OF THE SHELL MUST POINT INTO THE SCRIPT FOLDER

# Running samples
Navigate to the .\bin folder and run any sample you like
